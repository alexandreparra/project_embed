[Hashlink](https://hashlink.haxe.org/) is a virtual machine for the [Haxe programming language](https://haxe.org/). Its extensively used for game development and general purpose programming. Because of Haxe's compiler capability of
transpiling Haxe to many languages it's really suited for creating maintainable projects across different stacks and has gained popularity among game devs.

Hashlink has a focus on performance, it comes with a JIT for fast development and it can be transpiled into C to have even better performance. It can have native [native extensions](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/wiki/HashLink-native-extension-tutorial#why-creating-an-hashlink-extension) created with C/C++ to expose native functionality directly to Haxe/Hashlink.

Hashlink needs to be installed separately from Haxe.
